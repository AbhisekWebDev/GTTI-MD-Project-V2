                <b>What is a cancer disease?</b>

                <br>

                Cells are the basic units that make up the human body. Cells grow and divide to make new cells as the
                body needs them. Usually, cells die when they get too old or damaged. Then, new cells take their place.

                Cancer begins when genetic changes interfere with this orderly process. Cells start to grow
                uncontrollably. These cells may form a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. A
                cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor
                means the tumor can grow but will not spread.

                Some types of cancer do not form a tumor. These include leukemias, most types of lymphoma, and myeloma.
                <br>

                Types of cancer :
                Doctors divide cancer into types based on where it begins. Four main types of cancer are: <br>

                Carcinomas. A carcinoma begins in the skin or the tissue that covers the surface of internal organs and
                glands. Carcinomas usually form solid tumors. They are the most common type of cancer. Examples of
                carcinomas include prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.<br>

                Sarcomas. A sarcoma begins in the tissues that support and connect the body. A sarcoma can develop in
                fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, blood vessels, lymph vessels, cartilage, or bone.<br>

                Leukemias. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood. Leukemia begins when healthy blood cells change and grow
                uncontrollably. The 4 main types of leukemia are acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic
                leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia.<br>

                Lymphomas. Lymphoma is a cancer that begins in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network
                of vessels and glands that help fight infection. There are 2 main types of lymphomas: Hodgkin lymphoma
                and non-Hodgkin lymphoma

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Why does the cancer attack the body?</b>

                <br>

                As a cancerous tumor grows, the bloodstream or lymphatic system may carry cancer cells to other parts of
                the body. During this process, the cancer cells grow and may develop into new tumors. This is known as
                metastasis.

                One of the first places a cancer often spreads is to the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are tiny, bean-shaped
                organs that help fight infection. They are located in clusters in different parts of the body, such as
                the neck, groin area, and under the arms.

                Cancer may also spread through the bloodstream to distant parts of the body. These parts may include the
                bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Even if the cancer spreads, it is still named for the area where it
                began. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the lungs, it is called metastatic breast cancer, not
                lung cancer.

                <b>cancer disease symptoms</b>

                <br>

                Cancer can cause many symptoms, but these symptoms are most often caused by illness, injury, benign
                tumors, or other problems. If you have symptoms that do not get better after a few weeks, see your
                doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Often, cancer does not cause
                pain, so do not wait to feel pain before seeing a doctor. <br>

                To learn more about symptoms for a specific cancer, see the list of PDQ® cancer treatment summaries for
                adult and childhood cancers. Each summary includes detailed information about symptoms caused by a
                specific cancer.<br>

                Some of the symptoms that cancer may cause include:<br>

                <b>How are cancer diseases treated?</b>

                <br>

                Any cancer treatment can be used as a primary treatment, but the most common primary cancer treatment for the most common types of cancer is surgery. If your cancer is particularly sensitive to radiation therapy or chemotherapy, you may receive one of those therapies as your primary treatment.
