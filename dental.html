                <b>What is a dental disease?</b>

                <br>

                What is periodontal disease? Periodontal diseases are mainly the result of infections and inflammation
                of the gums and bone that surround and support the teeth. In its early stage, called gingivitis, the
                gums can become swollen and red, and they may bleed. Permanently damaged areas in teeth that develop
                into tiny holes.
                Causes include bacteria, snacking, sipping sugary drinks and poor teeth cleaning.
                There may be no symptoms. Untreated cavities can cause toothache, infection and tooth loss.
                Treatments include fluoride, fillings and crowns. Severe cases may need a root canal or removal. <br>
                Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops in a part of the mouth. It may be on
                the surface of the tongue, the inside of the cheeks, the roof of the mouth (palate), the lips or gums.

                <b>Why does oral/dental disease happen?</b>

                <br>

                Oral diseases are caused by a range of modifiable risk factors common to many noncommunicable diseases
                (NCDs), including sugar consumption, tobacco use, alcohol use and poor hygiene, and their underlying
                social and commercial determinants. <br> Factors that can increase your risk of mouth cancer include:
                Tobacco use of any kind, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff, among others.
                Heavy alcohol use. Excessive sun exposure to your lips. <br> Dental caries develops when bacteria in the
                mouth metabolize sugars to produce acid that demineralizes the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel and
                dentine).

                <b>How are oral diseases treated?</b>

                <br>

                Oral cancer is fairly common. It can be cured if found and treated at an early stage (when it's small and has not spread). A healthcare provider or dentist often finds oral cancer in its early stages because the mouth and lips are easy to examine.
                <br>
                surgery is the first treatment for cancers of the oral cavity and may be followed by radiation or combined chemotherapy and radiation. Oropharyngeal cancers are usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.
                <br>
                A dentist can prescribe fluoride treatments like mouthwash or varnish to reverse early tooth decay. You'll probably need a filling if you have a hole (cavity) in your tooth. If tooth decay has reached the soft tissue (pulp) in the middle of your tooth, you may need root canal treatment.
