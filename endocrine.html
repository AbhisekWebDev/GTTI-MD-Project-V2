                <b>What does endocrine system do?</b>

                <br>

                The endocrine system is responsible for regulating a range of bodily functions through the release of
                hormones.

                Hormones are secreted by the glands of the endocrine system, traveling through the bloodstream to
                various organs and tissues in the body. The hormones then tell these organs and tissues what to do or
                how to function. <br>
                Some examples of bodily functions that are controlled by the endocrine system include:<br>

                metabolism
                growth and development
                sexual function and reproduction
                heart rate
                blood pressure
                appetite
                sleeping and waking cycles
                body temperature <br>
                The glands of the endocrine system include the:<br>

                Hypothalamus. While some people don’t consider it a gland, the hypothalamus produces multiple hormones
                that control the pituitary gland. It’s also involved in regulating many functions, including sleep-wake
                cycles, body temperature, and appetite. It can also regulate the function of other endocrine glands.
                Pituitary. The pituitary gland is located below the hypothalamus. The hormones it produces affect growth
                and reproduction. They can also control the function of other endocrine glands.
                Pineal. This gland is found in the middle of your brain. It’s important for your sleep-wake cycles.
                Thyroid. The thyroid gland is located in the front part of your neck. It’s very important for
                metabolism.
                Parathyroid. Also located in the front of your neck, the parathyroid gland is important for maintaining
                control of calcium levels in your bones and blood.
                Thymus. Located in the upper torso, the thymus is active until puberty and produces hormones that are
                important for the development of a type of white blood cell called a T cell.
                Adrenal. One adrenal gland can be found on top of each kidney. These glands produce hormones that are
                important for regulating functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and stress response.
                Pancreas. The pancreas is located in your abdomen behind your stomach. Its endocrine function involves
                controlling blood sugar levels.

                <b>Why does the endocrine disease happen?</b>

                <br>

                Here’s a look at some conditions that can affect the endocrine system and alter your hormone levels.
                <br>

                Hyperthyroidism<br>
                Hyperthyroidism happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormone than necessary. This can be
                caused by a range of things, including autoimmune conditions.

                Some common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:<br>

                fatigue
                nervousness
                weight loss
                diarrhea
                issues tolerating heat
                fast heart rate
                trouble sleeping
                Treatment depends on how severe the condition is, as well as its underlying cause. Options include
                medications, radioiodine therapy, or surgery.

                Graves‘ disease is an autoimmune disorder and a common form of hyperthyroidism. In people with Graves‘
                disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid, which causes it to produce more thyroid hormone than
                usual.

                Hypothyroidism<br>
                Hypothyroidism occurs when your thyroid doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormone. Similar to
                hyperthyroidism, it has many potential causes.

                Some common symptoms of hypothyroidism include:<br>

                fatigue
                weight gain
                constipation
                issues tolerating the cold
                dry skin and hair
                slow heart rate
                irregular periods
                fertility issues
                Treatment for hypothyroidism involves supplementing your thyroid hormone with medication.

                Cushing syndrome<br>
                Cushing syndrome happens due to high levels of the hormone cortisol.

                Common symptoms of Cushing syndrome include:<br>

                weight gain
                fatty deposits in the face, midsection, or shoulders
                stretch marks, particularly on the arms, thighs, and abdomen
                slow healing of cuts, scrapes, and insect bites
                thin skin that bruises easily
                irregular periods
                decreased sex drive and fertility in males
                Treatment depends on the cause of the condition and can include medications, radiation therapy, or
                surgery.

                Addison’s disease<br>
                Addison’s disease happens when your adrenal glands don’t produce enough cortisol or aldosterone. Some
                symptoms of Addison’s disease include:<br>

                fatigue
                weight loss
                abdominal pain
                low blood sugar
                nausea or vomiting
                diarrhea
                irritability
                a craving for salt or salty foods
                irregular periods
                Treatment for Addison’s disease involves taking medications that help replace the hormones your body
                isn’t producing enough of.

                Diabetes<br>
                Diabetes refers to a condition in which your blood sugar levels aren’t regulated within a certain range.

                People with diabetes have too much glucose in their blood (high blood sugar). There are two types of
                diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.

                Some common symptoms of diabetes include:<br>

                fatigue
                increased hunger or thirst
                frequent urge to urinate
                irritability
                frequent infections
                Treatment for diabetes can include blood sugar monitoring, insulin therapy, and medications. Lifestyle
                changes, such as getting regular exercise and eating a balanced diet, can also help.

                Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)<br>
                This common condition is caused by unbalanced reproductive hormones in people with ovaries, which can
                create issues in the ovaries. Living with PCOS can mean that an egg may not be released every month, or
                may not develop as it should when it is released.

                Some of the common symptoms of PCOS are:<br>

                irregular periods
                fertility issues
                cysts that form on the ovaries
                acne
                hirsutism, which is an unusual amount of hair growth on the face or chin
                thinning hair
                weight gain
                skin tags
                Treatment for PCOS focuses on easing the symptoms. Treatments include medications, like birth control
                and metformin, and lifestyle changes, such as focusing on nutrition and trying to reach a moderate
                weight if your doctor has recommended it.

                Hypogonadism<br>
                A common condition, especially in older males and occasionally in females, hypogonadism is caused by a
                lowered production of the sex hormone testosterone. This can lead to lowered libido, as well as a
                variety of other symptoms, such as:<br>

                erectile dysfunction in people with a penis
                reduced energy
                reduced muscle mass
                depressed mood
                increased irritability
                Treatment for hypogonadism focuses on improved testosterone levels. Testosterone replacement therapy and
                lifestyle changes (such as working toward a moderate weight if your doctor has recommended it) are two
                popular methods.

                Osteoporosis<br>
                Osteoporosis is an abnormal loss of bone mass and changes in bone tissue. It can be caused by a variety
                of issues, but two common causes are lowered estrogen levels in people with ovaries and lowered
                testosterone levels in people with testicles. These lowered hormone levels can be caused by age, as well
                as other diseases.

                Osteoporosis doesn‘t always cause obvious symptoms. But some of the more common symptoms are bone
                fractures and injuries related to minor falls, lifting, and even coughing.

                Treatment for osteoporosis focuses on slowing or stopping bone loss. Proper nutrition, exercise, and
                medications are three of the most common treatments.
                <br>
                Acromegaly
                This rare disease is caused when the body makes too much growth hormone, which is mainly produced in the
                pituitary gland. Mostly diagnosed in middle-aged adults, it can cause organs, bones, cartilage, organs,
                and certain tissues to grow in size.

                The common symptoms of acromegaly include:<br>

                swollen nose
                swollen ears
                swollen hands and feet
                joint aches
                a deeper voice than usual
                an increase in sweating and body odor

                <b>How are endocrine diseases treated?</b>

                <br>

                Medication to rebalance hormones and treat symptoms.
                Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for patients with cancerous tumors of the endocrine gland.
                Surgery to remove a tumor on a gland that is affecting hormone production.
