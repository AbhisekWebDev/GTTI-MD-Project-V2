                <b>What is a brain disease?</b>

                <br>

                Neurodegenerative brain diseases
                They include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), among
                many others. They're most often slowly progressive and interfere with thought, memory, movement or some
                combination of these things. They're more common in the elderly.

                <b>Why mental disorder happens?</b>

                <br>

                Stressful life situations, such as financial problems, a loved one's death or a divorce. An ongoing
                (chronic) medical condition, such as diabetes. Brain damage as a result of a serious injury (traumatic
                brain injury), such as a violent blow to the head. Some common causes and risk factors of brain disease
                are: Environmental toxins and radiation: Long-term exposure to toxic chemicals and radiation may
                increase the risk of some brain diseases, such as brain tumors. Genetics: Certain genes and genetic
                mutations can cause or increase the risk of many brain diseases.
                <br>
                other brain disease risk factor is - cancer : The cause of brain cancer is still largely unknown.
                Although some genetic conditions and environmental factors may contribute to the development of brain
                cancer, the risk factors are much less defined for brain cancer than for other cancers in the body.
                Also, the risk of developing primary brain cancer is very low.

                not eating enough or overeating<br>
                having insomnia or sleeping too much<br>
                distancing yourself from other people and favorite activities<br>
                feeling fatigue even with enough sleep<br>

                difficult<br>
                for you to maintain normal behavior and activities. This period is sometimes called a nervous or
                mental<br>
                breakdown. Read more about these episodes and the symptoms they cause.<br>

                <br>

                <b>How are brain diseases treated?</b>

                <br>

                Counseling and cognitive behavior therapy to manage mental health concerns and provide emotional support. Diet, exercise and stress management to improve symptoms of some conditions such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis, and prevent recurrence of stroke. Medications to treat the disease and manage symptoms. <br> Brain tumors are treated with surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Our doctors also are studying a vaccine for treating a recurrent cancer of the central nervous system that occurs primarily in the brain, known as glioma. <br> Acute bacterial meningitis must be treated right away with intravenous antibiotics and sometimes corticosteroids. This helps to ensure recovery and reduce the risk of complications, such as brain swelling and seizures. The antibiotic or combination of antibiotics depends on the type of bacteria causing the infection.
