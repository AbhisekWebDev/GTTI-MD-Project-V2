                <b>What digestive system?</b>

                <br>

                The digestive system is a group of organs that work together to change the food you eat into the energy
                and nutrients your body needs. After you consume food and liquids, the digestive system breaks them down
                into their basic parts: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins. These basic nutrients are then
                absorbed into the bloodstream, which carries them to cells throughout the body. Nutrients provide the
                cells with the energy they need for growth and repair. Everything in your body, from your hormones to
                your heart, needs the nutrients from the digestive process to work correctly.

                <b>Why does the digestive disorder happens?</b>

                <br>

                Sometimes, one or more parts of the digestive system don’t work properly. This can cause anything from
                minor discomfort to serious health issues. The causes of functional digestive disorders may include a
                copious meal that is difficult to digest (e.g., fats, spices and acidic foods), eating food without
                chewing properly, drinking carbonated beverages or abusing alcohol, as well as stress or anxiety.

                <b>abdominal disease symptoms</b>

                <br>

                The symptoms of acid reflux and GERD include: <br>

                a burning sensation in the chest (heartburn) that sometimes moves up to the throat <br>
                a sour taste at the back of the mouth<br>
                trouble swallowing<br>
                dry cough<br>
                sore throat<br>
                nausea<br>
                burping<br>
                regurgitating food or sour liquid<br>
                feeling a lump in your throat<br>

                Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)<br>
                IBS is a collection of symptoms that affect the large intestine, causing extreme abdominal discomfort
                and pain. It’s a chronic condition that must be managed with long-term treatment. Most people with IBS
                can control their symptoms by modifying their diets and changing their lifestyle habits. Some people,
                however, may experience severe symptoms and need medication and counseling.<br>

                Common IBS symptoms include:<br>

                abdominal pain or cramps<br>
                bloating<br>
                gas<br>
                diarrhea<br>
                constipation<br>
                mucous in the stool<br>

                Acid Reflux and GERD<br>
                Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid or bile flows back up into the esophagus, causing heartburn and
                other uncomfortable symptoms. Most people experience acid reflux from time to time, especially after
                eating spicy food or heavy meals. When acid reflux happens more than twice per week, however, the
                condition is considered gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). While acid reflux can cause some
                discomfort, GERD has the potential to cause serious health problems.<br>

                The symptoms of acid reflux and GERD include:<br>

                a burning sensation in the chest (heartburn) that sometimes moves up to the throat<br>
                a sour taste at the back of the mouth<br>

                Maintaining Digestive Health <br>
                Keeping your digestive system healthy can help you avoid digestive problems. Follow these easy tips to
                keep your digestive system in tip-top shape:

                Eat seven or more servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Fruits and vegetables contain fiber,
                minerals, enzymes, vitamins and prebiotics that keep your digestive system healthy.
                Eat whole-grain breads, pastas, and cereals. Whole grains contain more fiber and nutrients than white
                “enriched” grain products and help your good colon bacteria flourish.
                Avoid processed meats, such as sausages and hot dogs, as they can cause problems with the digestive
                system. You should also limit your consumption of beef, pork, and lamb. These meats are most likely to
                carry bacteria that can harm the digestive system.
                Get enough calcium and vitamin D. You can prevent digestive problems by making sure you consume an
                adequate amount of calcium-rich foods and beverages, such as milk, tofu, and yogurt. Taking vitamin D
                supplements and safely increasing your exposure to sunlight can also help prevent digestive issues.
                Exercise regularly. Staying physically active can help maintain a healthy digestive system. Aim for 30
                minutes of moderate to vigorous activity at least three days per week.
                People who are overweight or underweight may be prone to more digestive problems. Exercising and eating
                a healthy diet can help lower your risk. If you’re struggling to lose or gain weight, talk to your
                doctor about what you can do.
